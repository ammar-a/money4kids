<a href="http://moneyforkids.ca/">A website to teach kids about money. </a>

I made moneyforkids.ca to teach my little 6 year old brother how to use money. The website has 3 tabs:
> Learn
Kids are shown different coins, and their value is represented in pennies. This helps them make the connection that some coins are worth more than others, regardless of the size of the coin.

> Practice
This is the most important part of kids learning. There are 10 questions, kids can practice until they get all of them correct. The website responds with instant feedback each time an answer is given.

>Certificate
After kids have practised, they can go to the certificate tab to answer a difficult question and unlock their certificate. Kids can type name onto the certificate, and then print it.
